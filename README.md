- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nico-reinsch
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a product manager with over 5 years of experience in various domains. My main focus was laid on NAV, but I also managed a project with Oracle Fusion Middleware, as well as a ruby on rails based web platform.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to teach myself some coding, so any hints, tips and tricks are very welcome ;)
